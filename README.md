# Fan Site

## This is a mock fan site for one of my favorite bands.

It's built in HTML, CSS, and JS, and is responsive at mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

The concept and design are based closely on an assignment I completed for bootcamp, with modifications to further develop my skillset.

Key differences between the original and this "Fansite":

### Original:
- Required BEM-style class names for HTML elements.
- Used SASS and @mixin/$variable features to write CSS.
- Used the Axios library to make HTTP requests to an external API

### New: 
- I used semantic HTML wherever possible, limited class names and kept extraneous wrappers to a minimum, working from a component-focused structure.
- I wrote vanilla CSS without any pre- or post-processors in order to try new native variable naming and nesting features.
- I used JavaScript's built-in fetch API to interact with the server.

Time permitting, I'll make a few minor improvements to clean it up.

This was a fun challenge and a great personal experience to see how my code has evolved from bootcamp to now.
